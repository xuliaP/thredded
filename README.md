Thredded works with SQLite, MySQL (v5.6.4+), and PostgreSQL. Thredded has no infrastructure
dependencies other than the database and, if configured in the parent application, the ActiveJob
backend dependency such as Redis. Currently only MRI Ruby 2.2+ is supported. We would love to
support JRuby and Rubinius as well.

If you're looking for variations on a theme - see [Discourse]. However, It is a full rails
application and not an engine like Thredded.

## Installation

### Creating a new Rails app with Thredded

Thredded provides an app generator that will generate a Rails app with Thredded, Devise, SimpleForm, RSpec, 
PostgreSQL, and a basic theme and navigation that is configured to work out of the box.

```sh
gem install thredded_create_app
thredded_create_app path/to/myapp
```

See `thredded_create_app --help` and the [thredded_create_app repo] to learn about the various options.

Then, see the rest of this Readme for more information about using and customizing Thredded.

[thredded_create_app repo]: https://github.com/thredded/thredded_create_app

### Adding Thredded to an existing Rails app

Add the gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'thredded', '~> 0.10.1'
```

Add the Thredded [initializer] to your parent app by running the install generator.

```console
rails generate thredded:install
```

Copy emoji images to your `public/emoji` directory.

```console
rake thredded:install:emoji
```

Thredded needs to know the base application User model name and certain columns on it. Configure
these in the initializer installed with the command above.

Then, copy the migrations over to your parent application and migrate:

```console
rake thredded:install:migrations db:migrate db:test:prepare
```

Mount the thredded engine in your routes file:

```ruby
mount Thredded::Engine => '/forum'
```

You also may want to add an index to the user name column in your users table.
Thredded uses it to find @-mentions and perform name prefix autocompletion on the private topic form.
Add the index in a migration like so:

```ruby
DbTextSearch::CaseInsensitive.add_index(
    connection, Thredded.user_class.table_name, Thredded.user_name_column, unique: true)
```

### Upgrading an existing install

1) To upgrade the initializer:

```console
rails g thredded:install
```

But then compare this with the previous version to decide what to keep.

2) To upgrade the database (in this example from v0.9 to v0.10):

```console
# Note that for guaranteed best results you will want to run this with the gem checked out with v0.10.0
cp `bundle show thredded`/db/upgrade_migrations/20170125033319_upgrade_v0_9_to_v0_10.rb db/migrate
rake db:migrate
```

### Migrating from Forem

Are you currently using [Forem]? Thredded provides [a migration][forem-to-thredded] to copy all of your existing data from Forem over
to Thredded.

[forem-to-thredded]: https://github.com/thredded/thredded/wiki/Migrate-from-Forem
[Forem]: https://github.com/rubysherpas/forem

## Views and other assets

### Standalone layout

By default, thredded renders in its own (standalone) layout.

When using the standalone thredded layout, the log in / sign out links will be rendered in the navigation.
For these links (and only for these links), Thredded makes the assumption that you are using devise as your auth
library. If you are using something different you need to override the partial at
`app/views/thredded/shared/nav/_standalone.html.erb` and use the appropriate log in / sign out path URL helpers.

You can override the partial by copying it into your app:

```bash
mkdir -p app/views/thredded/shared/nav && cp "$(bundle show thredded)/$_/_standalone.html.erb" "$_"
```

### Application layout

You can also use Thredded with your application (or other) layout by by setting `Thredded.layout` in the initializer.

In this case, you will need to reference your paths/routes carefully and pull in thredded assets (styles and javascript):

#### Reference your paths so that Thredded can find them

In your layout you will probably have links to other paths in your app (e.g. navigation links).
For any url helpers (like `users_path` or `projects_path` or whatever) will need to have `main_app.`
prefixed to them so that they can be found from thredded (`main_app.users_path` will work from both thredded and your app).

However if you don't want to update your layouts and partials, you can define methods automatically to delegate to the main_app's routes:
See https://gist.github.com/timdiggins/bf6d09b28828a392198562c93554ad07.

#### Add Thredded styles

In this case, you will also need to include Thredded styles and JavaScript into the application styles and JavaScript.

Add thredded styles to your `application.scss`:

```scss
@import "thredded";
```

Thredded wraps the views in a container element that has a `max-width` and paddings by default.
If your app layout already has a container element that handles these, you can remove the `max-width` and paddings
from the Thredded one by adding this Sass snippet after `@import "thredded";`:

```scss
.thredded--main-container {
  // The padding and max-width are handled by the app's container.
  max-width: none;
  padding: 0;
  @include thredded-media-tablet-and-up {
    padding: 0;
  }
}
```

See [below](#styles) for customizing the styles via Sass variables.

#### Add Thredded JavaScripts

Include thredded JavaScripts in your `application.js`:

```js
//= require thredded
```

Thredded is fully compatible with deferred and async script loading.

##### jQuery version

To use thredded with your application layout, you also need to ensure that your layout and thredded don't load different
versions of jQuery. By default, Thredded loads jQuery v3 (via `//= require jquery3` from [jquery-rails]),
but if you want to use jQuery v1 or v2, then you need to create a file at
`app/assets/javascripts/thredded/dependencies/jquery.js` which contains just `//= require jquery`
or `// require jquery2`. If you are not loading jQuery in your app, or if you are already using jQuery v3, then you don't need to do do this (You also don't need to worry about this if you are using the default ["Standalone" layout](#standalone-layout))

[jquery-rails]: https://github.com/rails/jquery-rails

Thredded views also provide two `content_tag`s available to yield - `:thredded_page_title` and `:thredded_page_id`.
The views within Thredded pass those up through to your layout if you would like to use them.

### User profile page

Thredded does not provide a user's profile page, but it provides a partial for rendering the user's recent posts
in your app's user profile page. Here is how you can render it in your app:

```erb
<%= Thredded::ApplicationController.render partial: 'thredded/users/posts', locals: {
      posts: Thredded.posts_page_view(scope: user.thredded_posts.order_newest_first.limit(5),
                                      current_user: current_user) } %>
```

The `user` above is the user whose posts are rendered, and `current_user` is the user viewing the posts or `nil`.
The policy scopes that limit the posts to the ones `current_user` can see are applied automatically.

The code above uses the `ApplicationController.render` method introduced in Rails 5. If you're using Rails 4,
you will need to add the [`backport_new_renderer`](https://github.com/brainopia/backport_new_renderer) gem to use it.

### Customizing views

You can also override any views and assets by placing them in the same path in your application as they are in the gem.
This uses the [standard Rails mechanism](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html#overriding-views) for overriding
engine views. For example, to copy the post view for customization:

```bash
# Copy the post view into the application to customize it:
mkdir -p app/views/thredded/posts && cp "$(bundle show thredded)/$_/_post.html.erb" "$_"
```

**NB:** Overriding the views like this means that on every update of the thredded gem you have to check that your
customizations are still compatible with the new version of thredded. This is difficult and error-prone.
Whenever possible, use the styles and i18n to customize Thredded to your needs.

#### View hooks

Thredded provides view hooks to customize the UI before/after/replacing individual components.

View hooks allow you to render anything in the thredded view context.
For example, to render a partial after the post content textarea, add the snippet below to 
the `config/initializers/thredded.rb` initializer:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
  Thredded.view_hooks.post_form.content_text_area.config.before do |form:, **args|
    # This is render in the Thredded view context, so all Thredded helpers and URLs are accessible here directly.
    render 'my/partial', form: form
  end
end
```

You can use the post content textarea hook to add things like wysiwyg/wymean editors, buttons, help links, help copy,
further customization for the textarea, etc.

To see the complete list of view hooks and their arguments, run:

```bash
grep view_hooks -R --include '*.html.erb' "$(bundle show thredded)"
```

## Theming

The engine comes by default with a light and effective implementation of the
views, styles, and javascript. Once you mount the engine you will be presented
with a "themed" version of thredded.

### Styles

Thredded comes with a light Sass theme controlled by a handful of variables that can be found here:
https://github.com/thredded/thredded/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/thredded/base/_variables.scss.

To override the styles, override the variables *before* importing Thredded styles, e.g.:

```scss
// application.scss
$thredded-brand: #9c27b0;
@import "thredded";
```

The `@import "thredded"` directive above will import thredded styles and the [dependencies][thredded-scss-dependencies]
(currently just "select2" from [select2-rails]). If you already include your own styles for any of thredded
dependencies, you can import just the thredded styles alone like this:

```scss
// application.scss
@import "thredded/thredded";
```

If you are writing a Thredded plugin, import the [`thredded/base`][thredded-scss-base] Sass package instead.
The `base` package only defines variables, mixins, and %-placeholders, so it can be imported safely without producing
any duplicate CSS.

[thredded-scss-dependencies]: https://github.com/thredded/thredded/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/thredded/_dependencies.scss
[select2-rails]: https://github.com/argerim/select2-rails
[thredded-scss-base]: https://github.com/thredded/thredded/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/thredded/_base.scss

### Email and other notifications

Thredded sends several notification emails to the users. You can override in the same way as the views.
See [this page](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/wiki/Styling-email-content) on how to style the emails.

If you use [Rails Email Preview], you can include Thredded emails into the list of previews by adding
`Thredded::BaseMailerPreview.preview_classes` to the [Rails Email Preview] `preview_classes` config option.

[Rails Email Preview]: https://github.com/glebm/rails_email_preview

You can also turn off the email notifier totally, or add other notifiers (e.g. Pushover, possibly Slack) by adjusting the
 `Thredded.notifiers` configuration in your initializer. See the default initializer for examples.

## I18n

Thredded is mostly internationalized. It is currently available in English, Brazilian Portuguese, Polish, and Spanish.
We welcome PRs adding support for new languages.

If you use thredded in languages other than English, you probably want to add `rails-i18n` to your Gemfile.
Additionally, you will need to require the translations for rails-timeago in your JavaScript before `thredded` but
after `jquery.timeago` (included in `thredded/dependencies`). E.g. for Brazilian Portuguese:

```js
//= require thredded/dependencies
//= require locales/jquery.timeago.pt-br
//= require thredded/thredded
```

## Permissions

Thredded comes with a flexible permissions system that can be configured per messageboard/user.
It calls a handful of methods on the application `User` model to determine permissions for logged in users, and calls
the same methods on `Thredded:NullUser` to determine permissions for non-logged in users.

### Permission methods

The methods used by Thredded for determining the permissions are described below.

* To customize permissions for logged in users, override any of the methods below on your `User` model.
* To customize permissions for non-logged in users, override these methods on `Thredded::NullUser`.

#### Reading messageboards

1. A list of messageboards that a given user can read:

  ```ruby
  # @return [ActiveRecord::Relation] messageboards that the user can read
  thredded_can_read_messageboards
  ```
2. A list of users that can read a given list of messageboards:

  ```ruby
  # @param messageboards [Array<Thredded::Messageboard>]
  # @return [ActiveRecord::Relation] users that can read the given messageboards
  self.thredded_messageboards_readers(messageboards)
  ```

#### Posting to messageboards

1. A list of messageboards that a given user can post in.

  ```ruby
  # @return [ActiveRecord::Relation<Thredded::Messageboard>] messageboards that the user can post in
  thredded_can_write_messageboards
  ```

2. A list of users that can post to a given list of messageboards.

  ```ruby
  # @param messageboards [Array<Thredded::Messageboard>]
  # @return [ActiveRecord::Relation<User>] users that can post to the given messageboards
  self.thredded_messageboards_writers(messageboards)
  ```

#### Messaging other users (posting to private topics)

A list of users a given user can message:

```ruby
# @return [ActiveRecord::Relation] the users this user can include in a private topic
thredded_can_message_users
```

#### Moderating messageboards

1. A list of messageboards that a given user can moderate:

  ```ruby
  # @return [ActiveRecord::Relation<Thredded::Messageboard>] messageboards that the user can moderate
  thredded_can_moderate_messageboards
  ```
2. A list of users that can moderate a given list of messageboards:

  ```ruby
  # @param messageboards [Array<Thredded::Messageboard>]
  # @return [ActiveRecord::Relation<User>] users that can moderate the given messageboards
  self.thredded_messageboards_moderators(messageboards)
  ```

#### Admin permissions

Includes all of the above for all messageboards:

```ruby
# @return [boolean] Whether this user has full admin rights on Thredded
thredded_admin?
```

### Handling "Permission denied" and "Not found" errors

Thredded defines a number of Exception classes for not found / permission denied errors.
The complete list can be found [here](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/blob/master/app/controllers/thredded/application_controller.rb#L18-L40).

Currently, the default behaviour is to render an error message with an appropriate response code within the Thredded
layout. You may want to override the handling for `Thredded::Errors::LoginRequired` to render a login form instead.
For an example of how to do this, see the initializer.

## Moderation

Thredded comes with two options for the moderation system:

1. Reactive moderation, where posts from first-time users are published immediately but enter the moderation queue
   (default).
2. Pre-emptive moderation, where posts from first-time users are not published until they have been approved.

This is controlled by the `Thredded.content_visible_while_pending_moderation` setting.

Users, topics, and posts can be in one of three moderation states: `pending_moderation`, `approved`, and `blocked`.
By default, new users are `pending_moderation`, and new posts and topics inherit their default moderation_state from
the user's.

When you approve a new user's post, all of their later posts will be approved automatically.

Additionally, users always see their own posts regardless of the moderation state. For blocked users, this means
they might not realize they have been blocked right away.

Blocked users cannot send private messages.

### Disabling moderation

To disable moderation, e.g. if you run internal forums that do not need moderation, run the following migration:

```ruby
change_column_default :thredded_user_details, :moderation_state, 1 # approved
```

### Enabling auto-follow

In some cases, you'll want all users to auto-follow new messageboard topics by default. This might be useful
for a team messageboard or a company announcements board, for example. To enable user auto-follow of new topics,
run the following migration(s):

```ruby
change_column_default :thredded_user_preferences, :auto_follow_topics, 1
```

## Plugins

The following official plugins are available for Thredded:

* [BBCode](https://github.com/thredded/thredded-bbcode) formatting for posts, e.g. `[b]for bold[/b]`. Can be used alongside Markdown.
* [Code Syntax Highlighting in Markdown](https://github.com/thredded/thredded-markdown_coderay) using Coderay.
* [TeX math via KaTeX in Markdown](https://github.com/thredded/thredded-markdown_katex), fast, accessible, JS-free math rendering.

Thredded is built for extensibility, and writing plugins for it is easy. If you plan on extending Thredded functionality
in a way others may benefit from, please consider making it a plugin.

## Development

To be more clear - this is the for when you are working on *this* gem.
Not for when you are implementing it into your Rails app.

First, to get started, migrate and seed the database (SQLite by default):

```bash
bundle
# Create, migrate, and seed the development database with fake forum users, topics, and posts:
rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

Then, start the dummy app server:

```bash
rake dev:server
```

To run the tests, just run `rspec`. The test suite will re-create the test database on every run, so there is no need to
run tasks that maintain the test database.

By default, SQLite is used in development and test. On Travis, the tests will run using SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL,
and all the supported Rails versions.

### Ruby

Thredded Ruby code formatting is ensured by [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop). Run `rubocop -a` to ensure a
consistent code style across the codebase.

Thredded is documented with [YARD](http://yardoc.org/) and you can use the
[inch gem](https://github.com/rrrene/inch) or the [Inch CI](http://inch-ci.org/github/thredded/thredded) to find code
that lacks documentation.

### JavaScript

Currently, Thredded JavaScript is written in the subset of ES6 that does not
require Babel polyfills. We're waiting for the ES6/7 support on Rails to improve
before updating this to full Babel.

All Thredded JavaScript is compatible with the following Turbolinks options:

* No Turbolinks.
* Tubrolinks 5.
* Turbolinks Classic.
* Turbolinks Classic + jquery-turbolinks.

Thredded JavaScript is also compatible with being loaded from script elements with
`[async]` and/or `[defer]` attributes.

To achieve the above, all the Thredded code must register onload via
`Thredded.onPageLoad`, e.g.:

```js
window.Thredded.onPageLoad(() => {
  // Initialize widgets:
  $('[data-thredded-select2]').select2();
});
```

Additionally, all the thredded views must be wrapped in a `<%= thredded_page do %>` block.

On Turbolinks 5 onPageLoad will run on the same DOM when the page is restored
from history (because Turbolinks 5 caches a *clone* of the body node, so
the events are lost).

This means that all DOM modifications on `window.Thredded.onPageLoad` must be
idempotent, or they must be reverted on the `turbolinks:before-cache` event,
e.g.:

```js
document.addEventListener('turbolinks:before-cache', () => {
  // Destroy widgets:
  $('[data-thredded-select2]').select2('destroy');
});
```

### Testing with all the databases and Rails versions locally.

You can also test the gem with all the supported databases and Rails versions locally.

First install PostgreSQL and MySQL, and run:

```bash
script/create-db-users
```

Then, to test with all the databases and the default Rails version (as defined in `Gemfile`), run:

```bash
rake test_all_dbs
```

To test with a specific database and all the Rails versions, run:

```bash
# Test with SQLite3:
rake test_all_gemfiles
# Test with MySQL:
DB=mysql2 rake test_all_gemfiles
# Test with PostgreSQL:
DB=postgresql rake test_all_gemfiles
```

To test all combinations of supported databases and Rails versions, run:

```bash
rake test_all
```

## Developing and Testing with [Docker Compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/)

To quickly try out _Thredded_ with the included dummy app, clone the source and
start the included docker-compose.yml file with:

```console
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

The above will build and run everything, daemonized, resulting in a running
instance on port 9292. Running `docker-compose logs` will let you know when
everything is up and running. Editing the source on your host machine will
be reflected in the running docker'ized application.

Note that when using [boot2docker](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker)
on a Mac make sure you visit the boot2docker host ip at
`http://$(boot2docker ip):9292`.

After booting up the containers you can run the test suite with the following:

```console
docker-compose run web bundle exec rake
```

The docker container uses PostgreSQL.
